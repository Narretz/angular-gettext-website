Angular-gettext is available on GitHub: [https://github.com/rubenv/angular-gettext](https://github.com/rubenv/angular-gettext).

All code lives in the `src` folder and is written in CoffeeScript. Try to stick to the style conventions used in existing code.

Tests can be run using `grunt test`. A convenience command to automatically run the tests is also available: `grunt watch`. Please add test cases when adding new functionality: this will prove that it works and ensure that it will keep working in the future.
